## General Info
This password generator was created using the provided starter code from the University of Utah coding bootcamp, which can be found [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet)

The password generator allows the user to select a length that they would like their password to be. The user is then asked if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters to be implemented in the generated password. After the decision is made, a password will be generated.
